   - Need to define which IP's Klocal can use, do we put this in GUI?
   - Possibly throw Macro engine into seperate project so each class
     implementing it can be invoked without TargetInvocationException

   - *done: Go back to old style of Campaign ID and Message ID
   - Use the message source from GUI if selected to do so.
   - *done: Implement CampaignCollection.cs/CampaignManager.cs
   - Create temporary copies of each recipient list, and process the supression
     when the campaign is started. Then alter the recipientProvider's filename.
   - Implement scheduling of PollItem. This is a much smarter method for
     processing tasks like this.
   - Modify the lvCampaign so it shows the status of the campaign. We need the
     statistics timer to read the status of a campaign, to know the next time
     it is to be ran, if it is running, etc.
     * This should be a method in CampaignManager.cs, 
     eg. public DataGrid[] GetRunningCampaigns 
     OR 
     public IList<Campaign> GetRunningCampaigns
   - Implement remote campaign management database functions!

   - Throttling class needs to be designed from the ground up.
   - Work on scheduling a bit, vague but it needs better way of showing on gui
   - Analysis; many ways to go about this. Need to decide what exactly will be
	   displayed, if it should be done in a seperate app space, or Konvict should
	   handle it in the polling, or should it be a mandatory poll item?
   - Maybe seperate class for KLocal, so we don't bloat Campaign.
   - *fixed: Work on KLocal Daemon. Sometimes the DNS fails, only with my VM so
     far, probably because of the way it's setup.

   - *fixed: it's appending to the domain list like a billion times.
     the domain list was like 2million in size after using konvict a few times.
   - *done: implement task scheduling. still looking for very best way to show on gui.
   - rename, duplicate campaign and messages. import campaign, the button
     already exists, but it is not functional.
   - *done: compress(+encrypt) serialized campaign data.
   
   - something neat in docs: http://174.37.141.226:8080/getlocalips
   - get the queue info of a domain: http://174.37.141.226:8080/listqueue?format=xml&queue=yahoo.com/*
   - i think i'll go with ssh over http :)

   - macro to grab random item from array. specifically this is needed for use
     of a random domain in the message body.
   - remove the static generation of boundary. a good example:
     boundary="aCAMP_IDa[id]a[list_id]a[listTDL_id]a"

   - 'format urls' dialog. the way permicity works, it saves all the images
     from the 'redirect url' to the webserver, and it creates the redirect
     with the directory structure and all. it does this before mailing
     begins. I was going to attempt to embed all the images, but I think
     it is not possible. the solution is to write a php script which can
     interpret commands and receive images from konvict, so it can setup
     the redirect.
      <a href="http://HOSTNAME/XXX/CAMP_ID/[id]/[list_id]/[listTDL_id]/"><img src="http://HOSTNAME/XXX/CAMP_ID/[id]/[list_id]/[listTDL_id]/" border=0></a>
     
   - richtextcontrol for html body editing. extremely low priority.

     
   - supression list. note: process it before mailing.
   - recipient list 'drop size'. [start_line],[send_amount]
     '2500,100000' will start at line 2,500, and send to 100,000 people.

   - grab statistics from server web gui, can request xml as output.
     permicity uses 'ssh server.com sudo /usr/sbin/pmta show status'
     we can probably get all the exact same info from the web gui in
     any format we like.
   - dialog to modify mta config, and then commit changes to the server.
